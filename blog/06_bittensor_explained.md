Bittensor is an open, decentralized network of machine intelligence. It enables the creation of a collaborative, market-driven ecosystem for AI models — where value is measured and rewarded on-chain.

---

## 🔁 Why It Matters

- **Decentralized Intelligence**  
  A distributed AI protocol where anyone can contribute and compete.

- **Open Marketplace for AI**  
  Subnets allow different models and tasks to flourish, each competing to serve users best.

- **Permissionless Innovation**  
  No gatekeepers. No single point of failure. Anyone can build, train, and monetize intelligence.

---

## 🧩 What is a Subnet?

A subnet in Bittensor is like an independent AI economy. Each subnet focuses on a specific task — such as text generation, translation, or image classification.

Subnets are:
- Created and managed by **subnet owners**
- Run by **miners** who provide task-specific AI outputs
- Curated by **validators** who score miners' performance

Each subnet defines its own rules and objectives. We plan to explore these in more detail in upcoming chapters of our fundamental analysis.

---

## 🧠 Incentivization, Validation & Consensus

Every subnet has two main participant roles:

- **Miners**: Run AI models to solve the subnet's task — like a machine learning problem
- **Validators**: Compete with one another to evaluate and score the miners' outputs

Validators must follow the **rules and scoring logic defined by the subnet**, and those who score accurately and fairly are rewarded.

This is Bittensor's version of **consensus** — it's not about agreeing on blocks, but on the **value of intelligence**.

---

## 🤝 How Does Consensus Work? (Yuma Explained Simply)

Bittensor uses a mechanism called **Yuma Consensus** to fairly and securely distribute rewards.

Here's how it works:

- **Validators rank miners** based on the quality of their responses
- These rankings are **weighted by two things**:
  - **Staked TAO** — validators with more skin in the game have more influence
  - **V-Trust (Validator Trust Score)** — validators who consistently align with the broader network gain more trust over time
- If a validator's ranking deviates too far from the network's consensus, it is **clipped** (partially ignored) to reduce manipulation
- **Miner rewards** are calculated from the **aggregate ranking**, which combines all validator scores, weighted by stake and trust

This ensures that:
- Validators are incentivized to rank honestly and align with consensus
- Miners are rewarded for producing useful outputs
- The system remains resistant to collusion and reward gaming

## 🪙 What Are Alpha Tokens?

Alpha tokens are **subnet-specific tokens** used for staking and rewards within each subnet (except Subnet 0).

- When you **stake TAO into a subnet**, it is automatically **swapped into that subnet's alpha token**
- You earn rewards denominated in alpha for your role in the subnet (as a validator or miner)
- When you **unstake**, your alpha tokens are converted back to TAO through the subnet's built-in exchange

### Rewards Flow:

- **Miners** earn alpha tokens based on how well they solve the subnet's problem
- **Validators** compete to assign scores — those who validate well are rewarded in alpha tokens

> In Subnet 0 (the root subnet), there are no alpha tokens. Staking and rewards happen directly in TAO.

## 🔄 Inspired by Bitcoin, Evolved for AI

Bittensor borrows from Bitcoin's design — including a capped supply and on-chain consensus — but replaces its Proof of Work with something radically different:

| Concept            | Bitcoin                    | Bittensor                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Work Type          | Hashing (SHA-256)          | Generating useful AI outputs  |
| Block Reward Basis | Puzzle solving             | Quality of intelligence        |
| Energy Cost        | High (hardware intensive)  | Lower (inference and scoring) |
| Who Scores You     | Protocol (automated)       | Validators (staked peers)      |

This is sometimes called **Proof of Intelligence**, or more broadly, **Proof of Useful Work**.

Miners don't just burn energy — they **compete to be smart**, and earn rewards based on the value they create.

---

## 💡 What Makes TAO Unique?

- **$TAO is the native token**  
  It's how intelligence is rewarded across the network.

- **Used for staking and governance**  
  TAO is used to enter subnets, validate others, and govern the system.

- **Scarce + Utility**  
  TAO has a capped supply and is essential to the network's economic loop.

---

## 📈 The Bull Case for Bittensor

- Emerging as the **data layer for decentralized AI**
- $TAO is positioned as the **native asset of open intelligence**
- Enables **protocol-level monetization** for AI innovation
- Riding two unstoppable trends: **crypto + AI**

> "Bittensor is the bridge between permissionless compute and decentralized intelligence."
