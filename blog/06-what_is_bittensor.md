# What is Bittensor?

Bittensor is an open, decentralized network of machine intelligence. It enables the creation of a collaborative, market-driven ecosystem for AI models — where value is measured and rewarded on-chain.

## 🔁 Why It Matters

- **Decentralized Intelligence**  
  A distributed AI protocol where anyone can contribute and compete.

- **Open Marketplace for AI**  
  Subnets allow different models and tasks to flourish, each competing to serve users best.

- **Permissionless Innovation**  
  No gatekeepers. No single point of failure. Anyone can build, train, and monetize intelligence.

## 💡 What Makes TAO Unique?

- **$TAO is the native token**  
  It's how intelligence is rewarded across subnets.

- **Value is earned, not staked**  
  Contributors earn TAO by providing useful computation.

- **Scarce + Utility**  
  TAO has a capped supply and real-world utility inside the protocol.

## 📈 The Bull Case for Bittensor

- Emerging as the **data layer for decentralized AI**
- $TAO is positioned as the **native asset of open intelligence**
- Enables **protocol-level monetization** for AI innovation
- Riding two trends: **crypto + AI**

> “Bittensor is the bridge between permissionless compute and decentralized intelligence.”
