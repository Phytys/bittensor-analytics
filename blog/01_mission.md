What if you could **rank subnets** by performance, trust, and actual network impact — not just speculation?

What if you could **see where the smart TAO is flowing**, track whale movements, and predict sustainability challenges — all in one clean dashboard?

That's the mission.

We aim to build the most **transparent**, **data-rich**, and **actionable analytics layer** for Bittensor. Think of it as a Bloomberg Terminal for decentralized AI — but open source, visually intuitive, and tailored for both power users and curious newcomers.

> Our goal is not just technical — it's educational.

By documenting our entire journey, we hope to contribute to a stronger, more comprehensible Bittensor ecosystem.
