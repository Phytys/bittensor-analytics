# Chapter 3: Subnet Scoring ‚Äî Our First Model

In the previous chapter, we examined the fundamental structure of each subnet ‚Äî from its TAO holdings and price to metadata like GitHub links and community presence. Now, we take our first step into building something more opinionated:

> A basic scoring model to assess and rank Bittensor subnets.

While this model is just a starting point, it marks the transition from passive data display to active interpretation.

## üßÆ What Is the Score?

The **score** is a weighted combination of key indicators we believe are early signals of subnet quality:

| Feature                 | Why We Use It |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `tao_in`                | Reflects trust, stake, and economic weight |
| `price`                | A proxy for demand or perceived value |
| `price_7d_pct_change`  | Measures recent trend or momentum |
| GitHub link present     | Suggests open development and transparency |
| Website present         | Indicates communication and credibility |

Each of these values is **normalized** to a 0‚Äì1 scale, and then combined using weighted coefficients (from `config.py`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Our First Scoring Formula

```python
score = (
    norm_tao_in       * 0.20 +
    norm_price        * 0.10 +
    norm_price_trend  * 0.10 +
    has_github        * 0.05 +
    has_website       * 0.05
)
```

The weights are easy to adjust later. We keep them simple now so that each factor is understandable.

## üîó Where Does the Data Come From?

We combine two TAO.app API endpoints:

- `/api/beta/analytics/subnets/info` ‚Üí gives current TAO-in, price, metadata
- `/api/beta/subnet_screener` ‚Üí gives `price_7d_pct_change` and other deltas

These datasets are merged using `netuid`, a unique identifier for each subnet.

---

## üìä The Dashboard in Action

The updated dashboard now includes:

- A **dropdown menu** to select the metric to visualize
- A **bar chart** showing top 15 subnets by the selected metric
- A **sortable table** with all subnets and their scores

## üß≠ What This Tells Us

Even with this basic score, we already see useful patterns:

- Subnets with large TAO-in but no GitHub rank lower than expected.
- New subnets with fast price growth start surfacing near the top.
- Dead or inactive subnets drop down the list naturally.

This builds our confidence that even a simple scoring model can help surface insights that aren't obvious from raw values alone.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Coming Up Next

Next, we'll start expanding the data model:

- Include APY data from `/apy/alpha`
- Integrate whale tracking using `/holders`
- Consider price sustainability and emission logic

And we'll revisit our scoring formula with each new layer ‚Äî evolving our model just like the network itself.
